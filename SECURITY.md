If it is directly affecting this fork, open an issue here.

## Supported Versions

We support the past two Go releases (for example, Go 1.17.x and Go 1.18.x when Go 1.18.x is the latest stable release).

See https://go.dev/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle and in particular the
[Release Maintenance](https://go.dev/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle#release-maintenance)
